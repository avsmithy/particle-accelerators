LaTex and Github
========

There are two parts to this. Latex is a way to write documents and git is how the latex code is stored and transferred around.

Git
---
The latex code which you can see above is all stored on Github. You can 'pull' this code, make changes and the merge your changes back here. Multiple people can do this at the same time without screwing anything up.

Grab the app from http://mac.github.com or http://windows.github.com.

Once you've got that setup (check the guides), click "Clone in Desktop" on the right.

Make changes to the latex code in your local repository. Then commit your changes (kinda like save) and push back to Github.
